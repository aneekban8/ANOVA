# ANOVA
Examples of ANOVA
The data contained in the file “tips1.xlsm” relates to the tip amount (in dollars) collected by a waiter, who worked on four days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday). Let us assume that these four days were the only days when the restaurant stayed open. The data contains 244 observations in all. The data also contains information on the total bill amount, sex of the payer, whether the group of customers contained a smoker, the time of the day (Lunch/ Dinner) and the size of the group. From this data, we generate a random sample of 120 observations by writing a macro in VBA and making use of the RANDBETWEEN function in Excel. The macro is contained in the file “tips1.xlsm”. The selected 120 observations are contained in the file “tips2_1way_UD_ANOVA_2.xlsx”. 
  The selected 120 observations are an example of unbalanced data as the number of observations for each of the days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday) are unequal. The objective is to test whether the mean tip amount is the same for all the four days (H0). This is done by means of ANOVA of one-way classified data for a fixed effects model. The ANOVA calculations are contained in the sheet “ANOVA 1 WAY” in the file “tips2_1way_UD_ANOVA_2.xlsx”. The calculated value of F-statistic (2.55493) is given in cell C16 (highlighted in red). The critical value of F (2.68281) is given in cell C17. Since the calculated value of F is less than the critical value of F, we accept, at 5% level, the null hypothesis; that is, we accept that there is no significant difference in the mean tip amounts for the four different days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday). The p-value of the test comes as 0.05875, given in cell C18 (highlighted in red). The same test using the same data is carried out in R. The R code is given in the file “aov_tips1.R”. The results from R are identical to those obtained in Excel.
